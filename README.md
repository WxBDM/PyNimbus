# PyNimbus
PyNimbus's goal is to take the "middle man" out of downloading and sorting data found from various National Weather Service products such as NHC and SPC outlooks.  

# Important Announcement

8/24/19 - I will be making this into a package and publishing it to PyPi. This will enable you to easily install it on your machine using `pip`. In addition, there will be more functionality with this project, such as (but not limited to) returning SPC outlook and NHC outlook polygons.

If you wish to contribute to this project, please get in contact with me via Twitter: @WxBDM (preliminary; until I figure out how to manage pull requests, etc). I will also be tweeting out updates on an as-needed basis.

See change log at bottom of this README file. More information to follow at a later time.
